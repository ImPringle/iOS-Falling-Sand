# iOS Falling Sand

This project is a falling sand simulator for iOS. The behavior of each particle is simulated by an algorithm based on **Cellular Automata** model.

This project contains two sections, a 2D falling sand simulator, and a 1D version just to demonstrate how it works lol.




## Why did I make this project?

Well I've been really interested in simulations, and I wanted to make my first simulation project, and I thought a falling sand simulator would be great for my first project, but I wanted to do it a little bit different.

Since I watched a lot of videos of this project, I noticed that none of those projects were made using Swift, so I decided to make my own version in Swift.

## Shoutout to The Coding Train
I want to say thanks to ***Daniel Shiffman*** who inspired me to make this project, and he is helping me a lot to understand computer science concepts.
